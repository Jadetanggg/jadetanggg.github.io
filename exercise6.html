        <p>Hello! My name is Jade Tang and I am a motivated and open-minded student currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in English with a concentration in Professional Writing and Technical Communications. I am on track to graduate from University of Massachusetts Amherst in May 2022. Law and Technology are two fields that I'm most interested in pursuing, but I love to learn and seeking an enriching opportunity to broaden my skillset.</p>
        <p>Thank you for visiting my website and I look forward to being in touch!</p>
