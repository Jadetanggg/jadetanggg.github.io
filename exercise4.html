    <h1>Possible images for my portfolio website</h1><br>
    <h2>Image #1:</h2>
    <p>I chose this picture because it combines two of my favorites: sunsets and going to the beach. I also have a dog and thought it was a good addition.</p>

    <h2>Image #2:</h2>
    <p>Growing up in Quincy, I loved living right outside of the city. There is so much to do and see in Boston and this picture shows the great skyline.</p>

    <h2>Image #3:</h2>
    <p>What draws me to technology is the efficiency of connection. I could use this picture to transition between sections.</p>

    <h2>Image #4:</h2>
    <p>For my check-in HTML exercise, I can use this picture to showcase my favorite music. I also though it was a cool picture with all of the elements.</p>
